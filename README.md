We have developed a real-time wheat disease diagnosis system, with the help of which it is possible to diagnose various diseases in a short time just by analyzing the images of wheat plants. It is thought that a revolution will happen in the agricultural sector of Bangladesh. Because in-field wheat disease diagnosis is very time-consuming and expensive, there is a possibility of false positive results in correct disease detection. Agricultural Head Bangladesh has a severe shortage of trained manpower in the agricultural sector. As a result, farmers are not able to meet the desired wheat production targets due to a lack of proper disease detection at the right time, resulting in a shortage of wheat in our agro-based economy. To overcome this crisis, we have developed a system through research, which can be easily used via mobile or computer and is capable of 97.95% accurate diagnosis.
